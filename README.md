# Election-Audit


Overview
The purpose of the project is to analyze the election results of three different counties. We calculated the percentage of votes of each county and also the county with the highest turnout. After that we used the given code to get the winner of the counties along with the number of votes and winning percentage.

Election Audit Analysis
This script is useful as it shows the number of votes per county and then calculates the total percentage of votes. It also calculates the votes and its percentages for the candidates. The script could be modified by adding code to add additional counties and candidates to the csv file. That would help provide more counties and different percentage of votes per county. There would also be different candidates to choose from as winners. Another way to modify script is to calculate the average number of votes as well as the median, and mode. This would help us determine if there are any outliers in the data set also.
